Weirdly enough, when I wrote that post about motivation yesterday, I didn't feel like doing anything, but ended up doing a lot more than usual.

# Unpredictable

This is what I'm talking about, you never know! You might wake up super happy and motivated, just to end up doing absolutely nothing.

But I think I figured out how to actually get things done.

## Work leads to work

The fact that I wrote that blog post completely and published it made me feel like I did something. By doing something small, but significant, you get the drive to do more.

Especially if you keep track of a bucket list, and you complete multiple small tasks, you'll end up doing a lot.

## No 0%-ers

You need to do something every day to build a habit. If you don't feel like doing anything at all, do just a small fraction of it. Do the smallest possible thing, just to avoid doing nothing.

# Conclusion

If you have a working habit, you have a working habit. If you don't, you need to build one. It's equally important for any job, chore, hobby.

Motivation can only come from within.
