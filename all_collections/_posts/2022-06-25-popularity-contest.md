If you're a developer, especially a web developer, you know that so many cool frameworks and technologies go under people's radars because something else is more popular, therefore more used in the industry.

In the case of web development: there are countless SPA front-end frameworks to choose from, but the majority of people learn react. It's the most widely used, and it's what employers look for.

# Svelte

[SvelteJS](https://svelte.dev/) is my favorite javascript front-end tool, I love it. Regardless of so much growth in popularity, the simple syntax and small bundle size, it will never reach it's full potential, for the simple fact of: it came out a little too late.

# The question

The question arises: Is it worth learning these less popular thing for the majority of people? I mean, if you're just looking for a job, you might not end up using it. Will that knowledge be wasted?

In my opinion, no knowledge is useless. It's knowledge, it's not like you won't have space in your brain for anything else if you learn something just for fun. So...

# **Go ahead!**

It's worth it! Learning can only drive you forward. You'll be doing yourself a favor, trust me. Keep coding (⌐■_■)
