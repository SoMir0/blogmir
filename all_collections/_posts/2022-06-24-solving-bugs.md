When you write software, you write bugs as well. It's inevitable. If you look closely enough, you will find bugs in all software.

Open source projects give us direct proof of this; Just check the amount of issues the repository has.

# Mitigation

To deliver the absolute best experience to the end user, you try to get rid of these bugs. But how would you go about doing that?

Personally, I look at the error message first, then the syntax, then the logic, then the internet. The error messages are good ways to mitigate small things, and usually tell you exactly what you've done wrong.

Then, you need to check if you misspelled something in the syntax. Happens to everyone, a totally normal thing.

> To reduce the amount of spelling mistakes, I'd recommend learning touch typing if you haven't.

And finally, you might have made a mistake in your thought process. You might be tired, or working late, and you try doing something thinking it would work.

Simply going through your addition/feature step-by-step might show you what you did wrong.

# The easy part

Once you know exactly what it is, that's causing your code to malfunction, it's easy to fix. Unless...

Unless it's a much bigger issue than you thought, that might be impossible to solve because of your old code and old decisions, or because you gave it little thought.

In any case, solving a major bug is the best feeling ever. Especially if the cause of the bug weren't you. Keep coding (⌐■_■)
