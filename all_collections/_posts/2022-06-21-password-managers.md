Password managers aren't exactly mandatory, but they very well should be. Your online presence is being traced, and using the same password everywhere is dangerous.

# The options

I'll be talking about two password managers.

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) and [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/).

The main difference here is that Bitwarden is online, therefore it syncs across your devices.

## Bitwarden

Having never actually used it, I'm recommending it based on other recommendations.

The reason I don't personally use an online password manager is the the fact that my password would be on a centralized server. Yeah, it's kinda silly, but I wouldn't trust a company with my passwords, that's all.

## KeePassXC

I've been using it for a while now. Creating groups and adding passwords is simple and straightforward, easy to figure out.

However, if you want to use the same passwords on your phone and other devices, you must backup your database to a cloud.

# Master password

The issue is, how do you make a master password? If this one is too weak, you lose all the other ones.

Here's my guide to creating a complex, yet easy to remember masterpass.

1. Pick two random words, not shorter than 5 letters.

Off the top of my head, intergallactic and obedient.

2. Mix them

`IntergallacticallyObedient`

I would suggest having at least one capital letter.

3. Add numbers and symbols

I'd suggest not using 123 and using at least one symbol.

This leaves us with a long, uncomplicated, easy to remember but strong master password:

`3Intergallactically2Obedient1$`

Be careful not to lose this one, or the database for that matter.
