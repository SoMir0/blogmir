So, what's the purpose of this blog?

![Blog](https://images.pexels.com/photos/262508/pexels-photo-262508.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1)

I mean, I'm sure no one's reading it. It's not like it would be of much use to anyone.

I think it's just for the sake of doing something new. For the sake of learning something and having fun. But I haven't written a post in a while, I find it hard coming up with ideas if no one's reading it.

So, it's not all that fun after all. But at least I deployed a blog to the internet. Not my domain, not my servers, not my SSG, not even my blog theme, but the blog is mine.

> Maybe I wanted to get better at markdown? Maybe I want to do something for my impostor syndrome to go away? Or just a thing to keep me busy until I get into college.

This may very well be the last post I make. I might start working on something new, or just get ready for college, or do nothing and play video games, either way...

# It was fun

If I do write a couple more posts, they'll be about whatever I'm thinking at the time and want to share. Bye now (⌐■_■)
