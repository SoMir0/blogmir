Motivation is such a weird thing. I'm talking from my own very limited perspective, but it's so very unpredictable.

---

One day I feel like working on something and being productive, I get somewhere with it, and the next one it's completely gone. It's like I never even cared for what I worked on in the first place.

I currently have more projects open and unfinished on my pc and laptop than on github. Combined, there's over 20 local projects, and there's like, 7 small ones that I actually put on github.

From time to time I get the need to learn something new, and I really do start learning. And just as things start coming along and making sense in my head, I quit.

It feels like this is more than just a little thing that any human has. This might be very problematic for me in the future.

As I was looking throught pexels to find an image for the term 'motivation', I realized that none of them quite fit. "You can do it", "You are loved", "do~~ubt~~". All this kind of generic stuff. Have a nice picture of space instead.

Is that really supposed to motivate me? I mean, it's not like I can't learn, it's that I simply find myself doing other useless stuff and wasting time. I can't get rid of these habbits.
