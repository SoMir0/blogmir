Window managers _(tiling wms, specifically)_ have completely changed the way I look at computers. They have pushed the limit of how productive humans can be with computers.

The first time I used one was on [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/). I learned about this cool thing that linux enthusiasts use and wanted to try it.

I honestly enjoyed configuring the [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org/) on my laptop, and after a week or so, I was pretty happy with the results.

Now, I'm using sway and dwm. I've configured many wms before, and have much to share.

# Efficiency

All tiling window managers that I know of have workspaces. Basically, it's like workspaces on desktop environments, or desktops on windows _(although those are pretty unusable compared to these)_, where you have 10 by default, you can put as many windows on each as you like, and switch between them easily.

It's so fast that I don't even need more than one monitor. It's as fast as looking to the side to see your other monitor.

> Different wms take care of multiple monitors differently, and there's pretty good multi-monitor support in general.

# Customizability

Doesn't that just look awesome? ~~pun intended~~

You can make wms look however you want, add as many things as you want, etc.

> The downside here is that most users aren't ready to edit a text file to configure something.
> Knowledge of a programming language is not necessarily required

I used to have so much fun ricing when I started, now I just settle for something simple, a couple colors from my wallpaper of choice.

_All this productivity, and I still end up procrastinating..._

But yeah, if you're a linux user, there's no reason not to try one of these in your free time.
